OEMScan automates multi-manufacture installation Windows CD's by
scanning the bios (0xE0000-0xFFFFF) for a Royalty OEM's SLP string 
and copying over the appropriate OEMBIOS files for windows XP activation.

Requirements:
Windows XP
OEM SLP Key
SLP Identifier(s)
OEMBIOS File set(s)

Instructions:
Modify the oemscan.ini file to suit your needs.

[section title] =  SLP Identifier 
PATH     =  Location of the OEMBIOS file set
RANGE    =  Comma separated list of memory ranges <32bit address>:<size> if no range is specified
            the default range of 0xE0000:0x20000 is used (see example)
MATCHARG =  will replace @@@@ in CMD with its value (see example)
CMD      =  Command to run if a match is found

PATH, RANGE, MATCHARG, and CMD are optional

Examples:
The following example will search for "Gateway" @ F000:32F0 and F000:3110
for 0x20(hex) bytes. If found it will copy the OEMBIOS fileset from 
".\Gateway\" to the appropriate directories and run "SystemRoot%\notepad.exe c:\boot.ini"

[Gateway]
PATH=".\Gateway\"
RANGE="0x000F32F0:20, 0x000F3110:20"
MATCHARG="c:\boot.ini"
CMD="%SystemRoot%\notepad.exe @@@@"


The following example will search for Compaq
and if found run "SystemRoot%\notepad.exe c:\boot.ini"

[Compaq]
MATCHARG="c:\boot.ini"
CMD="%SystemRoot%\notepad.exe @@@@"


The following example will search for Lenovo
and if found copy over the oembios fileset in ".\Lenovo\"

[Lenovo]
PATH=".\Lenovo\"

Notes:
SLP Identifiers are parsed from top down, place more 
restrictive file sets at the begining of the file.

[_SM_] can be placed at the end of the oemscan.ini 
file to be used as an else statement if no matching 
SLP strings are found.

The decrypted OEMBIOS.DAT file contains 16bit memory addresses
which need to be converted to 32bit addresses for use in the RANGE parameter. 

Example:
BIOS=F000,E840,20,Gateway

F000,E840 = 16bit address..  20 = size, Gateway = SLP Identifier.
To convert a 16bit address to a 32bit address move (shift) the high word F000 over one and add the low word E840 giving you 0xFE840

OEMBIOS file sets and SLP Identifiers can be obtained from http://www.oembios.net 

Return Values:
Critical Error = -1
No Match = 0
Match = 1
