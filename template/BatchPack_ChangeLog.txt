BUG: NTRegOpt will lock the registry from any more changes until next boot. (where 990_2ndBoot.cmd runs)
run it last?

Rev 0.9.1
  Using shortcuts to run 1stBoot.cmd and 2ndBoot.cmd instead of RunOnce due to reg 
  changes after first boot to desktop.  It would cause it to reboot twice after 
  first desktop boot.
  
Rev 0.9.0
  Fixed IE Home Page registry issue.
  Fixed persistent IE, OE, and WMP shortcuts on Start Menu.
  Shortcuts and IE settings don't take after first complete desktop boot. No matter 
  what I do.  Setting final IE tweaks and "persistant" shortcut deletions to run from
  2ndBoot.cmd, called by REG ADD from 1stBoot.cmd
  Running 1stBoot.cmd and 2ndBoot.cmd from HKCU..\RunOnce
  Offloaded work from CleanUp.cmd to RunOnceEx and 2ndBoot.cmd  Cleanup is mainly for 
  the Start Menu.
  
Rev 0.8.7
  Using different logging method by calling subroutines instead of appending 
  >>install.log to every line.  Haven't been able to get it to work with wget yet.
